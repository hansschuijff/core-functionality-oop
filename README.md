# Core Functionality

The site-specific functionality of De Witte Prins, independent of the theme, as a small microkernel.
The plugin finds its own modules and features and starts only those that fit the site: the active
plugins and theme, the server tier (development, staging, production), admin or front end, and what is
switched on under Settings → Core Functionality.

Requires WordPress 7.0 and PHP 8.2. Updates through [Git Updater](https://git-updater.com/) from the
GitHub releases. Architecture and decisions: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

This is the OOP successor of the legacy `core-functionality` plugin. Both are installed side by side
while features move over, which is why the folder is still called `core-functionality-oop`.

## First time

    composer install            # autoloader and the coding standards (phpcs)

The release zip contains `vendor/` without the development packages, so a site needs no Composer.

## Adding a feature

A feature lives in its own folder under its module and is found automatically:
`src/Modules/<Module>/Features/<Feature>/<Feature>.php`. It describes itself in `get_meta()` and
does its work in `launch()`; everything else comes from `AbstractFeature`.

```php
<?php
/**
 * Hide Comments Feature.
 *
 * @package DeWittePrins\CoreFunctionality
 * @since   1.0.0
 */

declare( strict_types=1 );

namespace DeWittePrins\CoreFunctionality\Modules\Cleaner\Features\HideComments;

use DeWittePrins\CoreFunctionality\Abstracts\AbstractFeature;
use DeWittePrins\CoreFunctionality\DTO\ComponentMeta;
use DeWittePrins\CoreFunctionality\Enums\Orientation;
use Override;

use function __;
use function add_filter;

/**
 * Class HideComments
 *
 * Closes comments on every post.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
 */
class HideComments extends AbstractFeature {

	/**
	 * Returns the descriptive data of this feature.
	 *
	 * @since  1.0.0
	 * @return ComponentMeta Id, name, description and requirements.
	 */
	#[Override]
	public static function get_meta(): ComponentMeta {
		return new ComponentMeta(
			id:           'cleaner_hide_comments',
			name:         __( 'Hide comments', 'core-functionality' ),
			description:  __( 'Closes comments on every post.', 'core-functionality' ),
			orientation:  Orientation::FRONTEND,   // Default: Orientation::BOTH.
			dependencies: 'woocommerce',           // Optional: environment id(s) that must be ready.
		);
	}

	/**
	 * Adds the hooks of this feature.
	 *
	 * @since  1.0.0
	 * @return void
	 */
	#[Override]
	public function launch(): void {
		add_filter( 'comments_open', '__return_false' );
	}
}
```

Then, on the settings page, **Feature Activation → Scan for new features** adds it to the
components register, after which you can switch it on and set its deployment tier. `$this->plugin`
(services such as `settings`) and `$this->module` are available in the feature.

On a site that gets the feature through a plugin update, the register is refreshed automatically: the
new feature gets its enabled state and tier from `kernel/`, and an administrator sees a notice.

## Adding a module

A module only groups features: `src/Modules/<Module>/<Module>.php`, extending `AbstractModule` with
just `get_meta()`. Its features go in `src/Modules/<Module>/Features/`.

## Adding a plugin or theme to the environment

A guard class represents an outside plugin or theme: it proves the plugin really started and supplies
the plugin's admin links, from which the quick menu in the admin toolbar is composed.

1. Add `src/Environment/Plugins/<ClassName>.php` extending `AbstractPlugin`. `get_id()` returns the class
   name in kebab-case (`MyPlugin` → `my-plugin`).
2. Add the id and the plugin basename to `settings/environment-index.php`
   (`'my-plugin' => 'my-plugin/my-plugin.php'`).
3. `get_proof_requirements()` returns what exists once the plugin has started (a class, function or
   constant), checked on `init`. Classes are checked without autoloading.
4. `get_toolbar_nodes()` and `get_menu_nodes()` return the plugin's admin links. The toolbar links of
   every known plugin are offered in the menu builder, also when the plugin is not active, so
   `get_toolbar_nodes()` may only call WordPress functions directly: a URL that needs the plugin
   itself goes in a closure (`href: fn () => wc_get_page_permalink( 'shop' )`). The `orientation` of a
   shortcut says whether it links to an admin page or to the site; where it is shown is set in the
   menu builder.

Themes work the same in `src/Environment/Themes/` with the id suffix `-theme`; their index entry holds
the theme name and author.

## Hooks

| Hook | Type | Default | Arguments | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `core-functionality/ready` | action | | | `add_action( 'core-functionality/ready', 'my_start' );` |
| `core-functionality/launch-timing` | filter | `init`, priority `0` | `array{hook: string, priority: int} $timing` | `add_filter( 'core-functionality/launch-timing', fn () => array( 'hook' => 'wp_loaded', 'priority' => 10 ) );` |
| `core-functionality/register-settings-sections` | action | | `AdminSettingsPage $page` | `add_action( 'core-functionality/register-settings-sections', fn ( $page ) => $page->register_section( MySettings::class ) );` |
| `core-functionality/admin-menu-config-nodes` | filter | The admin menu items from the settings files | `AdminMenuConfigNode[] $config_nodes` | `add_filter( 'core-functionality/admin-menu-config-nodes', fn ( $nodes ) => $nodes );` |
| `core-functionality/admin-menu-removals` | filter | The admin menu slugs to remove | `string[] $slugs_to_remove` | `add_filter( 'core-functionality/admin-menu-removals', fn ( $slugs ) => array_merge( $slugs, array( 'edit-comments.php' ) ) );` |

To run code from another plugin once Core Functionality has started, whether or not that already
happened:

```php
if ( did_action( 'core-functionality/ready' ) ) {
	my_start();
} else {
	add_action( 'core-functionality/ready', 'my_start' );
}
```

(A public API for this is planned; see the open points in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.)

## Code style and checks

WordPress Coding Standards with PSR-4 class files, `declare( strict_types=1 );` everywhere and
`core-functionality/<name>` hook names. See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the conventions.

    composer phpcs              # check
    composer phpcbf             # fix what can be fixed automatically
    composer lint               # php -l on all PHP files

## Translations

Source strings are English, text domain `core-functionality`; `languages/` holds the `.pot` and the
Dutch translation. After changing strings (in DDEV, from the site folder):

    ddev wp i18n make-pot wp-content/plugins/core-functionality-oop wp-content/plugins/core-functionality-oop/languages/core-functionality.pot --domain=core-functionality --exclude=vendor,___,kernel,src/Modules/LegeModule,src/Modules/ActiveWoo/dev-notes

Then update `languages/core-functionality-nl_NL.po` (Poedit or Loco Translate) and create the `.mo`:

    ddev wp i18n make-mo wp-content/plugins/core-functionality-oop/languages/core-functionality-nl_NL.po wp-content/plugins/core-functionality-oop/languages

## Release

1. Raise the version in the plugin header of `core-functionality.php` and the `Stable tag` in
   `readme.txt`, and add a changelog entry in `readme.txt`.
2. Commit, tag `vX.Y.Z` and push the tag. `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds the zip (with
   `vendor/`, without development files) and attaches it to the GitHub release.
